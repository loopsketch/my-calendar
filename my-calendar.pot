"to being displayed in smaller spaces, such as the sidebar. The "
"<code>category</code> attribute requires either the name of or ID number one "
"of your event categories (the name is case-sensitive). This will show a "
"calendar only including events in that category. Multiple categories can be "
"specified by separating the category names or IDs using the pipe character: "

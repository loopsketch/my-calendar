"The shortcode supports three attributes, <code>category</code>, "

"events. The <code>category</code> attribute requires either the name of or "
"ID number one of your event categories (the name is case-sensitive). This "
"will show a calendar only including events in that category. Multiple "
"categories can be specified by separating the category names or IDs using "
"the pipe character: <code>|</code>. Setting <code>showkey</code> to "
